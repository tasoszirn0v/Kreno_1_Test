IM app
This a project for Instant Messaging (IM) app created for academic purposes and is focused in front-end design & development using Android Studio and Kotlin.
The back-end server is executed by Firebase (Authentication by phone number+SMS with verification code (OTP), database Realtime DB, cloud storage for user created content, FCM for push notifications).
The project is connected to my master thesis about encrypted IM apps focusing on E2EE (esp. Signal protocol & app).
Starting from scratch, testing cryptographic primitives (algorithms and hash functions), crypto libraries and various implementantions...
At this point finished checking symmetric (cipher AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding) with prefixed 256-bit key/128-bit iv
Next step to check ECIES scheme (BC or Tink) & hopefully sth more...
WIP!!!
